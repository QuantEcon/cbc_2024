# Recursive Utility: Solution Methods

## Outline

In some dynamic models, lifetime utility is nonlinear and defined recursively.

*  models with Epstein-Zin preferences
*  risk-sensitive preferences
*  models with ambiguity aversion
*  robust control models
*  adversarial agents

In this lecture we explore how to compute lifetime utility in some of these settings.

Our main focus will be the Epstein-Zin setting.

Uncomment if necessary:

```{code-cell} ipython3
#!pip install quantecon
```

We will use the following imports.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from collections import namedtuple
import time
import quantecon as qe

jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
```

## Model


### The EZ recursion

For Epstein--Zin preferences, lifetime utility from time $t$ onwards is given by

$$
V_t = \left\{
        C_t^\rho + \beta (\mathbb E_t V_{t+1}^\gamma)^{\rho/\gamma} 
      \right\}^{1/\rho}
$$

Here

* $(C_t)$ is a consumption path that is being valued by the agent
* $\beta \in (0,1)$ and $\gamma, \rho$ are nonzero
* $\mathbb E_t$ is time $t$ expectation
* $V_t$ is lifetime utility generated by $C_t, C_{t+1}, C_{t+2}, \ldots$
  
One way to understand the recursion above is to write it as

$$
V_t = \left\{
        C_t^\rho + \beta (\mathcal E_t V_{t+1})^\rho
      \right\}^{1/\rho}
$$

where $\mathcal E$ computes the ``risk-adjusted expectation'' 

$$
\mathcal E Y = (\mathbb E Y^\gamma)^{1/\gamma}
$$

* $\gamma$ governs risk aversion
* $\rho$ governs elasticity of intertemporal substitution

### A Markov Formulation

We suppose $C_t = c(X_t)$ where $X_t$ is a Markov process taking values in state
space $S$.

We guess the solution has the form $V_t = v(X_t)$ for all $t$, where $v$ is some
function over the state space $S$.

In this case we can write the above equation as

$$
v(X_t) = \left\{
        c(X_t)^\rho + \beta (\mathbb E_t v(X_{t+1})^\gamma)^{\rho/\gamma} 
      \right\}^{1/\rho}
$$

Let's suppose that $(X_t)$ is a Markov chain with transition matrix $P$.

Then the last equation tells us that we need to solve for $v$ in

$$
    v(x) 
    = \left\{
        c(X_t)^\rho + \beta \left[\sum_{x'} v(x')^\gamma P(x, x')\right]^{\rho/\gamma} 
      \right\}^{1/\rho}
$$


We define the operator $K$ sending $v$ into $Kv$ by

$$
    (Kv)(x) 
    = \left\{
        c(X_t)^\rho + \beta \left[\sum_{x'} v(x')^\gamma P(x, x')\right]^{\rho/\gamma} 
      \right\}^{1/\rho}
$$

We seek a fixed point of $v$ (i.e., a $v$ with $Kv=v$).

## Solvers

To solve for a fixed point of $K$ we use two methods.

The first is successive approximation (also called fixed point iteration): pick any $v$ and then iterate with $K$.

The second is Newton's method, which is used to find the $v \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $F(v) = 0$.

We can use Newton's method to find a fixed point of $K$ by setting $F(v) = Kv - v$.

Newton's method for finding a zero of $F$ is to iterate on

$$
v_{k+1} = v_k - J(v_k)^{-1} F(v_k) 
$$

where $J(v)$ is the Jacobian of $F(v)$.

In general

* Newton's method has a faster rate of convergence (quadratic vs linear)
* Successive approximation is more robust and can be quicker due to smaller constant terms in the rate of convergence.

Here are our two solvers.

```{code-cell} ipython3
def successive_approx(K, v_init, max_iter=50_000, tol=1e-8):
    "Compute the fixed point of K by iterating from guess v_init."
    
    i, error = 0, tol + 1
    v = v_init
    while error > tol and i < max_iter:
        v_new = K(v)
        error = np.max(np.abs(v_new - v))
        i += 1
        v = v_new
    return v, i


def newton_solver(K, v_init, max_iter=10_000, tol=1e-8):
    """
    Apply Newton's algorithm to find a fixed point of K. 

    We use a root-finding operation on F(v) = K(v) - v, which requires 
    iterating with the map 

        Q(v) = v - J(v)^{-1} F(v).

    Here J(v) is the Jacobian of F evaluated at v.

    """
    F = lambda v: K(v) - v
    @jax.jit

    def Q(v):
        J = jax.jacobian(F) 
        return v - jnp.linalg.solve(J(v), F(v))
    return successive_approx(Q, v_init, tol=tol, max_iter=max_iter)
```

### Solution

In solving the model, we need to specify the function $c$ in $C_t = c(X_t)$ and the state process.

For the state process we use a Tauchen discretization of 

$$
    X_{t+1} = \alpha X_t + \sigma Z_{t+1},
    \qquad \{Z_t\} \text{ is IID and } N(0, 1)
$$

We assume that $c(x) = \exp(x)$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
c = jnp.exp
```

Here's the model.

```{code-cell} ipython3
Model = namedtuple('Model', ('ρ', 'γ', 'β', 'α', 'σ', 'x_vals', 'c_vals', 'P'))

def create_ez_model(ρ=1.6,
                    γ=-12.0,
                    α=0.9,
                    β=0.998,
                    σ=0.1,
                    n=1_000):
    mc = qe.tauchen(n, α, σ)
    x_vals, P = jnp.exp(mc.state_values), mc.P
    c_vals = c(x_vals)
    P = jnp.array(P)
    return Model(ρ, γ, β, α, σ, x_vals, c_vals, P)
```

Here's the operator $K$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
@jax.jit
def K(v, model):
    ρ, γ, β, α, σ, x_vals, c_vals, P = model
    return (c_vals**ρ + β * (P @ v**γ)**(ρ / γ))**(1 / ρ)
```

Let's solve it using the two different solvers and see which is faster.

```{code-cell} ipython3
model = create_ez_model()
ρ, γ, β, α, σ, x_vals, c_vals, P = model
v_init = c_vals
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
start_time = time.time()
v_sa, num_iter = successive_approx(lambda v: K(v, model), v_init)
sa_time = time.time() - start_time
print(f"Successive approximation converged in {num_iter} iterations.")
print(f"Execution time = {sa_time:.5} seconds.")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
start_time = time.time()
v_newton, num_iter = newton_solver(lambda v: K(v, model), v_init)
newton_time = time.time() - start_time
print(f"Successive approximation converged in {num_iter} iterations.")
print(f"Execution time = {newton_time:.5} seconds.")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(f"Newton time / succ. approx. time = {newton_time / sa_time}")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x_vals, v_sa, label='successive approx', ls='--')
ax.plot(x_vals, v_newton, lw=1, label='newton')
ax.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Exercise

Step $\sigma$ through `0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125`, in each case computing the solution and plotting lifetime utility (all on the same figure).

How does increasing volatility affect lifetime utility?

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Put your code here.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
for i in range(18):
    print("Solution below! 🐇")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
v_init = c_vals
sig_vals = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for σ in sig_vals:
    model= create_ez_model(σ=σ)
    v, _ = newton_solver(lambda v: K(v, model), v_init)
    v_init = v
    ax.plot(x_vals, v, label=f"$\sigma = {σ:.4}$")
ax.legend(frameon=False)
plt.show()
    
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
